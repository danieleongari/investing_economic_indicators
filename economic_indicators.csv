Note that methodology of calculating money supply varies between countries. M2 is a monetary aggregate that includes all physical currency circulating in the economy (banknotes and coins), operational deposits in central bank, money in current accounts, saving accounts, money market deposits and small certificates of deposit. Excess money supply growth potentially can cause inflation and generate fears that the government may tighten money growth by allowing the interest rates to rise which in turn, lowers future prices.

The PPI shows the same general pattern of inflation as does Consumer price index, but is more volatile. This is because it is weighted more heavily towards goods that are traded in highly competitive markets and somewhat less sensitive to changes in the cost of labour. In principle, the PPI should include service industries. But in practice it is limited to the domestic agricultural and industrial sector. The prices should be farm-gate prices for the agricultural sector and ex-factory prices for the industrial sector. The PPI is worth watching as a leading indicator of inflation at the consumer level.

Depending on the degree of liquidity chosen to define an asset as money, various monetary aggregates are distinguished: M0, M1, M2, M3, M4, etc. Not all of them are used by every country. Note that methodology of calculating money supply varies between countries. M2 is a monetary aggregate that includes all physical currency circulating in the economy (banknotes and coins), operational deposits in central bank, money in current accounts, saving accounts, money market deposits and small certificates of deposit. Excess money supply growth potentially can cause inflation and generate fears that the government may tighten money growth by allowing the interest rates to rise which in turn, lowers future prices. M2 = Currency in circulation + demand deposits (private sector) + time and savings deposits (private sector)."

A region's gross domestic product, or GDP, is one of the ways for measuring the size of its economy. Expenditure approach - Total expenditures on all finished goods and services produced within the economy. Calculation: GDP using the expenditure approach is derived as the sum of all final expenditures, changes in inventories and exports of goods and services less imports of goods and services. Market influence of GDP Unexpectedly high quarterly GDP growth is perceived to be potentially inflationary if the economy is close to full capacity; this, in turn, causes bond prices to drop and yields and interest rates to rise. Where the stock market is concerned on one side higher than expected growth leads to higher profits and that's good for the stock market. On the other, it may increase expected inflation and lead to higher interest rates that are bad for the stock market. Larger than expected GDP growth will tend to appreciate the exchange rate as it is expected to lead to higher interest rates."

Trading involves the lender, i.e., the Central Bank, purchasing securities with a condition that the borrower will buy them back on a specified day, hence the term ""repurchase agreements."" The incentive for such transactions is the credit institutions' need for short-term liquidity. Central banks can take advantage of this need to influence market interest rates. In Iceland the Central Bank holds weekly auctions of 7-day repos. Credit institutions are required to put up qualified securities as collateral, i.e., securities carrying a treasury guarantee and with active market making on Iceland Stock Exchange. Auctions can be either in terms of fixed prices, i.e. when the Central Bank offers to buy an unlimited amount of securities at a specified yield, or the total amount of agreements on offer is announced and the return is determined by market conditions, at least within certain limits. Fixed-price auctions have been the rule so far in Iceland."

It ensures that the relative importance of different property types in different regions remains fixed throughout the life of the index. Different adjustment must be used as no two houses are identical. Therefore characteristics such as physical attributes of a house or its location should be included in the calculation if the index. Rising house prices are likely to increase consumer confidence and consumer spending which lead to rising aggregate demand. This can have two effects. On one hand it causes higher economic growth. However, on the other hand, it might contribute to inflation. Increased consumer spending is usually aimed at imported goods thus higher house prices cause current account deficit."

The individual price changes are sorted in ascending order from fell the most to rose the most, and a certain fraction of the most extreme observations at both ends of the spectrum are like a skaters best and worst marks thrown out, or trimmed. The inflation rate is then calculated as a weighted average of the remaining components. For the series presented here, 19.4 percent of the weight from the lower tail and 25.4 percent of the weight in the upper tail are trimmed.

In accounting, payroll refers to the amount paid to employees for services they provided during a certain period of time. Payroll plays a major role in a company for several reasons. From an accounting point of view, payroll is crucial because payroll and payroll taxes considerably affect the net income of most companies and they are subject to laws and regulations (e.g. in the US payroll is subject to federal and state regulations). From an ethics in business viewpoint payroll is a critical department as employees are responsive to payroll errors and irregularities: good employee morale requires payroll to be paid timely and accurately. The primary mission of the payroll department is to ensure that all employees are paid accurately and timely with the correct withholdings and deductions, and to ensure the withholdings and deductions are remitted in a timely manner. This includes salary payments, tax withholdings, and deductions from a paycheck."

Current account records the values of the following: - trade balance exports and imports of goods and services - income payments and expenditure interest, dividends, salaries - unilateral transfers aid, taxes, one-way gifts It shows how a country deals with the global economy on a non-investment basis. Balance of payments shows strenghts and weaknesses in a country's economy and therefore helps to achieve balanced economic growth. The release of a balance of payments can have a significant effect on the exchange rate of a national currency against other currencies. It is also important to investors of domestic companies that depend on exports. Positive current account balance is when inflows from its components into the country exceed outflows of the capital leaving the country. Current account surplus may strengthen the demand for local currency. Persistent deficit may lead to a depreciation of a currency."

U.S. Treasury Bonds have maturities from ten up to 30 years. Governments issue treasuries to borrow money to cover the gap between the amount they receive in taxes and the amount they spend to refinance existing debt and/or to raise capital. The rate on a Treasury Bond represents the return an investor will receive by holding the bond for its entire duration. All bidders receive the same rate at the highest accepted bid. Yield fluctuations should be monitored closely as an indicator of the government debt situation. Investors compare the average rate at auction to the rate at previous auctions of the same security.

Bank of Korea Act stipulates that the purpose of this Act is “to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by pursuing price stability through the formulation and implementation of efficient monetary policy”. Accordingly, the Bank of Korea takes price stability as the most important objective of its monetary policy. If prices become unstable, uncertainty concerning the future mounts, discouraging economic activities as a whole, and the distribution of income and resources grows distorted. As a result, the stabilityin economic conditions as a whole is damaged. In order for the national economy to achieve stable growth, it should be supported by not only price stability but also financial stability. Regarding this, Article 1, Clause 2 of the「Bank of Korea Act」 stipulates that “The Bank of Korea needs to pay attention to financial stability in the implementation of monetary policy”. Thus, the Bank of Korea is also making policy efforts to maintain financial stability while pursuing price stability through implementing its monetary policy."
